Step-by-step guide to a fresh install of Raspian and the associated software for project Ottershaw on a Raspberry Pi.

/---------------------------------/
Installing Raspian (Raspberry Pi OS)

I assume no access to an external monitor/ keyboard/ TV screen in this tutorial.

Hardware Requirements:
- Linux Laptop/Desktop
- SD card reader
- Raspberry Pi B / B+
- SD card to fit Raspberry Pi
- Internet connection
- Access to router's administration page (home router, not on Stevens network)
	|- If on managed network you'll need a personal router to set up a LAN

1. Follow this guide (much more step-by-step, but very long):
http://www.robertawood.com/blog/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-initial-setup-headless-no-monitor-or-keyboard-needed.html
	|- dd will take awhile (its a byte by byte copy)
	|- Alternatively, you can use the GUI imaging tool inside Ubuntu (it works very well)
	1.1 Make sure to expand the file system at the end in the last step!

//Todo attach wpa_supplicant file
2. Once installed and connected to wifi (see attached wpa_supplicant.conf file) run (via ssh):
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade



/---------------------------------/
Setting up Git



/---------------------------------/
Setting up Slack integration
1. Install pip (for downloading python packages) 
	sudo apt-get install python-pip
	sudo cd pip install slacker

2. Change host name of raspberry pi (network identifier of the Pi)
	2.1 'sudo nano /etc/hosts' and change the 127.0.1.1 hostname
	2.2 'sudo nano /etc/hostname' and change to the same hostname
	2.3 'sudo /etc/init.d/hostname.sh'to commit changes
	2.4 reboot

3. Place pi_slackip_notify.py in raspberry pi home directory
	//TODO attach this file

4. Modify the bootup script to run pi_slackip_notify.py
	4.1 'sudo nano /etc/rc.local'
	4.2 Place the following two lines immediately after the file's beginning comments:
		sleep 10
		python /home/pi/pi_slackIP_notify.py 
	4.3 Exit the file
	4.4 run 'sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local' to make the script execute on boot
	4.5 Reboot, check if it integrated with Slack

NOTE: Unique keys in the pi_slackip_notify.py will need to be modified per Slack account

/---------------------------------/
Installing ROS (Indigo at the time of this writing)
Primary: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
Comments for help: http://answers.ros.org/question/192250/raspberry-pi-with-ros-indigo-or-any-new-release-of-ros/

1) Follow http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
2) Run all of step 1 of the tutorial in sudo su replacing 'wheezy main' with 'utopic main'
3) If wstool in step 2.1 fails, re-enter sudo su and run 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py | python' to re-install broken setup-tools on raspian install (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7446187/no-module-named-pkg-resources)
	Note 1: This step is actually a bitch. Don't get frustrated -- just keep working at it.	
	Note 2: You'll probably need to start this whole section over from the beginning if this failed. Also consider trying sudo apt-get autoclean before starting over to remove incomplete packages.
4) Carefully run the section 2.2 resolve dependencies (or else things gun break)

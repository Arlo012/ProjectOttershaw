Project Ottershaw Arduino Uno 1
=================================


Note that this code nearly fills the memory capacity of an Arduino Uno.

This code runs as an independent ROS node that will publish only gyro data to the core.

It runs a slightly modified AHRS code to integrate gyro, compass, and accelerometer.
